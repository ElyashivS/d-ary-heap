# d-ary-heap

A d-ary heap is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) non-leaf nodes have d children instead of 2 children.

In this project, we implemented a d-ary heap, and answered the followoing questions:

a. How would you represent a d-ary heap in an array?

b. What is the height of a d-ary heap of n elements in terms of n and d?

c. Give an efficient implementation of EXTRACT-MAX in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.

d. Give an efficient implementation of INSERT in a d-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.

e. Give an efficient implementation of INCREASE-KEY (A, i, k), which flags an error if k < A[i], but otherwise sets A[i] = k and then updates the d-ary maxheap structure appropriately. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.
